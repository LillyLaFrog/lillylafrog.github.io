            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Lilly Williams. LillyLaFrog Game Studio came from my love of video games, art, and programming. Video games tell stories in such an engaging and immersive fashion. My goal with making video games is not to make something you can use to burn time and use as an escape, but I want to make something that lasts long after you press the 'quit' button. I want to tell a story that creates an impact and leaves people with a new perspective. People often use technology to suppress or ignore emotions, but I want to make something that enhances them. I strive to construct characters that people can relate to. I want to show that things we may see as flaws make us who we are. It's okay to be weird because that "weirdness" makes us unique.</p>

            <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Can I stream gameplay of your games?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Yes! I would really appreciate it if you did! Word of mouth is the most valuble form of advertizing I have right now, so streaming it helps others find my games.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Is your upcoming game going to be free?</strong></dt>
                <dd>I don't think so. I'm putting a lot of work into this game, and I'm releasing it on Steam, so it needs to cost something for me to make back my investment (both my time and Steam's fee). How much exactly? I'm not sure. I need to finish the game first to see how much I think it's worth. If I had to guess, probably somewhere between $5 and $20</dd>
                <dt><strong>Where can I play your games?</strong></dt>
                <dd>France Fries is out now on the <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fryguy.france_fries">Google Play Store</a> and on the web at the <a href="francefries.html">France Fries</a> page on the website and at <a href="https://frenchfrygame.weebly.com/">frenchfrygame.weebly.com</a></dd>
